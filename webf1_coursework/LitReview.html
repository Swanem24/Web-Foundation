      <h1>Mitigating corporate information exposure on the web</h1>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Lots of Company uses the web to attract business opportunities. However, using the web without internet security knowledge can backfire a company and lose important information. Information exposure causes companies to suffer negative consequences such as losing their customers trust, reduction in stock price and lose incomes. Ponemon’s (2011) study found that only 29 percent of Organizations have the necessary security controls in place to mitigate risks and security issues. That means only a small amount of organizations have plan to mitigate risks and the rest of the 71 percent of organizations will have huge consequences if their confidential information were to be exposed.</p>

      <h3>Mitigation Technique</h3>
      <p>Studies have shown that companies has came up with several ways to mitigate information exposure. As more and more company become concerned about potential risk the more companies will plan to mitigate risks. A study by (Curry, 2011) showed that the weakest link in security is the human link. This means information exposure are caused due to humans having lack of knowledge about social security. There are many studies supports this. One of them was by (Roger Thompson) thousands of spyware applications are downloaded every day in large Organizations whose employees uses the Internet. This reveals that employee downloads spywares from the internet without them knowing about it. Phishing is another way of stealing information from large Organization, it mirrors a legitimate message. If an employee falls for a phishing email, it will cause sensitive information to get exposed, malware gets installed into the system and steal identity. (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2016) revealed more than 17,000 victims, which accounted for $2.3 billion in losses. As more of those incidents happened Organizations has started to acknowledge phishing as a major threat therefore they took action to prevent phishing. (Hong, J.) revealed three techniques: automated removal of phishing message, automated mechanism that notifies when encountered a suspicious websites or message, individual are taught to identify and report attacks. A study by (Chi, 2011) said giving proper user education and training to raise security awareness and personal responsibility in order to help prevent social media security incidents. This study suggested a solution that the Organizations should educate their employees to raise security awareness so that it will minimise the chance of information getting exposed. Since, human are the weakest link it is only logical to fix it first. However, another study by Cisco Systems (2008a, b) counters that by revealing security policies do not always work effectively because, about 34 percent of employees do not understand security policies and underestimate security risks even though these employees have been briefed. If employees underestimates security risks even after they have been briefed then that would backfire Organizations, not only will they have wasted their time but also money for hiring network security educator to educate their employees. This problem could be solved by firing employees who underestimates security risks and replace it with someone who is reliable.
 However, it is hard to find the exact employee that are not following the security policies unless there is an attack that was caused by an employee downloading malware into the company’s computer system. Therefore, a study by (Chi, 2011) encouraged the employees to use a corporate support browser and use strong passwords for social media sites. This study shows that using corporate support browser filters out the suspicious sites and blocks them so that employee who are not aware of those sites can be avoided. Also setting a strong passwords can cause hackers hard to break through. Unsecured website could cause employees to install malware or steal credit card details when making a transactions. A research report by Clearswift(2011) reveals that 68 percent of companies monitors employee internet activity and 56 percent of the companies block access to some sites. Another study by (Zhang, 2011) revealed that companies restricts login to popular social media sites in the workplace. Restricting popular social media sites is an effective method because, everyone uses popular social media so, if an employee does leak a confidential information it will spread very quickly among people and it will be very difficult to remove all of them. Two studies suggested the idea of Organization monitoring social media site. It allows Organization to know whether or not people are exposing information about their Organizations on the internet. This allows Organization to respond immediately before it gets read by their competitor. Organizations should scan the internet and search out misuse of the enterprise brand on a regular basis (CDC, 2009). Tools such as Google Alerts can help Organizations to keep track of malicious activities and threats against the Organizations that hackers sometimes discuss publicly (Zeltser, 2011). Once a confidential information is leaked through social media, it will spread very quickly therefore, Organizations must respond immediately to take down the threat before it spreads out. However, Organizations are not certain about when information are going to get leaked which cause the person in charge of monitoring to get bored of waiting and not be on alert.
Organizations should ensure that firewall is updated, antivirus and antispyware software are installed on employee’s computers and other devices they use (Chi, 2011). This study suggests that not updating firewall could allow hackers to bypass and access confidential information because of the firewall not being able to keep new threats out. A study by (Kawamoto, D.) Anti-spyware systems effectively shield users from spyware. However, their low adoption rate continues to be a problem. New spyware are created everyday therefore, anti-spyware becomes less adaptive.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>In conclusion, website offers great opportunities to attract business opportunity but there are consequences and Organizations should acknowledge it. Because, not only will it affect them but it will also affect the customer’s trust as they have shared their sensitive information. Organizations should choose carefully when hiring employees because, they are the major cause for information exposure. As more and more Organization uses the web, the chance of publishing confidential information and downloading malwares increases. There are numerous ways to prevent information exposure that Organizations can use. Organizations should update their systems often as anti-spyware becomes less adaptive and hackers constantly comes up with new ways to steal information.</p>
